# How to Contribute

> *There are many ways to contribute to Open Source as you may know. But I'll discuss the primary one first*.

The most important form of contribution is **adding your own question(s)** to the App from any Language.

I'll take a full **question example** to walk you through the steps.

---
## Step 1
---
Open the folder named [questionStorage](./questionStorage/), there you'll see four files:
* beginnerQs.js
* intermediateQs.js
* advancedQs.js
* ninjaQs.js

In each of the files(**e.g. beginnerQs.js**), you'll see this code snippet(provided we have no beginner question yet)

```js
const beginnerQs = () => ([

]);
```
The `Array` the arrow function returns, takes a **list** of objects known as the **Question Objects**.

> Important Note: If you're not familiar with JavaScript:
> * **Arrays** have syntax similar to the `List` data structure in Python. Like this: `[]`.
> * ***Object* Literals** have syntax similar to the `Dictionary` data structure in Python. Like this: `{}`
> ```js
> // javascript object literal syntax
> {
>   propertyName: propertyValue, 
> }
> ```
> *Pretty Easy!!!* **In Python**, the propertyName will be wrapped in quotes(string), it's also string in JS but you don't have to, unless you're accessing it like this: `object['propertyName']`
---
To add a question, go into the `Array` and include an **Object Literal** at the end of the array *provided one or more question object was initially present*. Now you'll have a snippet that looks like this:

```js
const beginnerQs = () => ([
    /* a question object */
    {

    },
    /* another question object */
    {

    },
]);
```
Now you want to fill the question object with these properties, **the values are explained in the steps that follow**.
```js
const beginnerQs = () => ([
    {
        language: /* value */,
        questionType: /* value */,
        questionStatement: /* value */,
        code: /* value */,
        options: /* value */,
        correctAnswer: /* value */,
        explanation: /* value */,
        reference: /* value */,
        githubProfile: /* value */,
        twitterProfile: /* value */,
    },
]);
```
---
## Step 2 (`language` property) (Mandatory)
---
> Value Type: String

This property takes the language string on which you're setting the question.

> Important Note: Provide the full abbreviation name of the language in **lowercase letters** For example, **cplusplus**, **NOT** **C++**, **cs**(for csharp) **NOT** **C#**, **c**, **javascript**, **python**, **ruby**, **html5**, **css3**.
```js
{
    language: 'python',
}
```
---
## Step 3 (`questionType` property) (Mandatory)
---
> Value Type: String

This property can take either of the two values: `single-answer` or `multiple-answers`.
* single-answer: If the question requires the user to select only one answer from the options given.
* multiple-answers: If the question requires the user to select more than one answer from the options given.
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
}
```
---
## Step 4 (`questionStatement` property) (Mandatory)
---
> Value Type: String

This property takes the question statement. For example, *What is the output of this code?*, *How many Object Types are there in Python?*
> Tip: You can use text formatting style to format the sentence like these:
> * **Bold** (\*\*bold text\*\*)
> * *Italic* (\*italized text\*)
> * Underline (\_\_underlined text\_\_)
> * `Code` ( \`code snippet\` )
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
}
```
---
## Step 5 (`code` property) (Optional)
---
> Value Type: Empty String('') or Template String(\`code snippet/block\`)
* If the question has **no code snippet**, the value would be an **empty string** ('').
* If the question has a code snippet, the value will be a code snippet **single-line** or **multi-line**, cleanly indented in **Double Backtics**(a.k.a. Template String).

> Tip: To create an empty blank line, use the newline escape character **\n**

Case 1: No Code snippet included
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
}
```
Case 2: Code snippet included
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'What is the output of this code?',
    code: `
    def add(a, b):
        sum = a + b
        return sum
    \n
    print(add(5, 6))
    `,
}
```
---
## Step 6 (`options` property) (Mandatory)
---
> Value Type: \<String\>Array 

This property takes an Array that contains a list of **4 options**, all list items(options) must be wrapped in quotes, i.e. it must be a **string data type**. *Try as much as possible to make your options compact.*

> Note: If array item includes an empty string, **wrap around the empty string an alternate quote** e.g. `"''"`. This is because JavaScript will read it as a JavaScript empty string and not a normal string as you have wanted it to be. An empty string to JavaScript is nothing.\
> *Bonus Tip: An empty string in JavaScript is a **falsy string**. Because String Data Types are truthy values and empty ones are falsy.*
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
}
```
---
## Step 7 (`correctAnswer` property) (Mandatory)
---
> Value Type: String or \<String\>Array
The value of this property is in **two cases**.
* Case 1: If your `questionType` value is **single-answer**, the `correctAnswer` value as you might have guessed will be a **string** that is the **correct answer** amongst the options given in the `options` property.
* Case 2: If your `questionType` value is **multiple-answers**, then the `correctAnswer` value will be an Array of Strings that includes the **correct answers** amongst the options given in the `options` property.

Case 1:
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: 'Dictionary',
}
```
Case 2:
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'multiple-answers',
    questionStatement: 'Select all Sequence Types in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String'],
}
```
> Note: Read the note on the previous step.
---
## Step 8 (`explanation` property) (Mandatory)
---
Value Type: String\
Give your explanation, you can also use text formatting syntax here:
> * **Bold** (\*\*bold text\*\*)
> * *Italic* (\*italized text\*)
> * Underline (\_\_underlined text\_\_)
> * `Code` ( \`code snippet\` )
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'multiple-answers',
    questionStatement: 'Select all Sequence Types in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String'],
    explanation: '**Sequence Types** in Python are __String, List and Tuple__',
}
```
---
## Step 9 (`reference` property) (Optional)
---
Value Type: '' (empty string) or \<Markdown hyperlink syntax\>String
* Case 1: **No reference**\
Value is an empty string.
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: 'Dictionary',
    explanation: '**Sequence Types** in Python are __String, List and Tuple__',
    reference: '',
}
```
* Case 2: **link text, but no link address**\
Value is this string syntax '\[linkText\]\(\)'\
When you do this, you have an program that converts the link text into a **search query** for google.
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: 'Dictionary',
    explanation: '**Sequence Types** in Python are __String, List and Tuple__',
    reference: '[Learning Python]()',
}
```
* Case 3: **link text, link address**\
Value is this string syntax '\[linkName\]\(linkAddress\)'
```js
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: 'Dictionary',
    explanation: '**Sequence Types** in Python are __String, List and Tuple__',
    reference: '[Learning Python](https://www.learningpython.com)',
}
```
---
## Step 10/11 (`githubProfile/twitterProfile` property) (Optional)
---
> Value Type: '' (empty string) or \<Markdown hyperlink syntax\>String

Even though this is Optional, I bet 90% developers will include this, *(smiles)*. As you'd have guessed, the value is a **hyperlink to your profile**, the guide for **Step 9** applies equally for these two steps.
> Warning: **Case 2 for Step 9** doesn't apply, You must have a username and a profile address. I guess you know that. Also your **link text** is your **username**, while your **link address** is a link to your **respective profiles**.
```js
/* a complete question object */
{
    language: 'python',
    questionType: 'single-answer',
    questionStatement: 'Which of these is **not** a Sequence Type in Python?',
    code: '',
    options: ['List', 'Tuple', 'String', 'Dictionary'],
    correctAnswer: 'Dictionary',
    explanation: '**Sequence Types** in Python are __String, List and Tuple__',
    reference: '[Learning Python](https://www.learningpython.com)',
    githubProfile: '[Mckenney17](https://www.github.com/Mckenney17)',
    twitterProfile: '[Mckenney17](https://www.twitter.com/Oluwarinolasam2)',
}
```

Okay!!! Oh! Oh!  I know this is long, but it's not complex, I just had to be detailed. You don't want a pull request rejected due to things you aren't aware of right?

* Please!!! Raise Issues! Raise Issues! Raise Issues! Raise Issues!
* *List goes on...*

> Final Words:\
I developed this App with the developer community in mind, it came from the idea that, what if as we learn day-by-day, we set quizzes from what we've learnt and share it to others, and also gain from others by solving their own quizzes too. And so I decided to create this. **We own this App together**, I'm just opportuned to be the creator, so lets nuture this baby together. I believe this App will solve some problems posed to the developer community, MOST ESPECIALLY FOR BEGINNERS.\
The highest good remark you could give to me or this App is:
> * Spreading the news about the App.
> * Contibuting to the App: Adding Questions, Fixing Bugs and more...

*I love you, I love the DEV Community. Thanks!*
